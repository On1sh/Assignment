    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baking bread at home is a fulfilling culinary endeavor that
         fills your kitchen with the aroma of freshly baked goodness.
        To start, gather your ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, 
        and optionally, sugar or honey for sweetness.
        In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar 
        or honey (if using).
        Slowly add warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing until 
        a sticky dough forms.
        Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes 
        smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes.
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a kitchen
         towel, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in
          size, usually about 1-2 hours.
          <br></br>
        Once risen, punch down the dough to release air bubbles,
         then shape it into a loaf or rolls.
        Transfer the shaped dough to a baking sheet or loaf pan,
         cover, and let it rise again for another 30-60 minutes.
        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the bread for 
        25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when 
        tapped on the bottom.
        
        Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing and 
        serving. Enjoy the warm, freshly baked bread with butter or 
        your favorite toppings.
