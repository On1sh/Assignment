        Making mozzarella cheese at home is a rewarding culinary adventure that promises fresh, creamy goodness in every bite. To start, gather your ingredients: whole milk, rennet, citric acid, and cheese salt. In a large pot, heat the whole milk over medium-low heat until it reaches around 90°F (32°C). Stir occasionally to prevent scorching. Dissolve citric acid in 1/4 cup of cool water and add it to the warm milk, stirring gently for about 30 seconds. Then, dilute rennet in 1/4 cup of cool water and pour it into the pot, stirring for another 30 seconds. Cover the pot and let it sit undisturbed for 5-10 minutes to allow the milk to curdle. Once curds form, cut them into small pieces with a knife and heat them to around 105°F (40°C). Drain the whey from the curds by ladling them into a cheesecloth-lined colander. Microwave the curds, knead them until stretchy, and shape them into balls or logs. Cool the cheese in ice water, then store it in the refrigerator for up to a week.
